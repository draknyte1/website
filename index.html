                <h2>About minecraft.ga</h2>
                <p>Build, destroy, act like an admin or simply go crazy. Minecraft.ga gives you an opportunity to check out what it's like being an admin or moderator on a server. With access to operator (OP) commands and features used by server staff, you can do a lot of things. Keep in mind that we have to block a few commands, like /ban, /kick, /stop etc., so people won't abuse too much.</p>
				<p>Minecraft.ga uses a fast and lightweight server software called MCServer C++. You get access to commands from Core and Essentials, two great plugins made for MCServer. To make it easier for you, you can also take advantage of a plugin called WorldEdit, which helps you build much faster than normally.</p>
				<p>The world on Minecraft.ga resets automatically once every week, simply to give you a fresh and lag-free experience. You can save your buildings and continue building on them after the world has reset, more info about this will be given once you join the server.
