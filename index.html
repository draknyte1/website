                <h2>About Minecraft.ga</h2>
                <p>Minecraft.ga provides you a unique and interesting experience in Minecraft. This server allows you to do whatever you want; griefing, acting like a staff member, building - you name it. A large set of operator (OP) commands is granted for you to use whenever you like, as well as a few server plugins, such as WorldEdit. With no rules, this is the perfect place to do what you may not be allowed to do elsewhere.</p>
				<p>Minecraft.ga uses an auto restart function, which assures the server will always stay up for you to play on. To give you a fresh and lag-free experience, the world will also reset automatically every Sunday. If you need to reach us, please send a mail to hello@minecraft.ga!</p>
