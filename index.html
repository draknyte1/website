                <h2>About minecraft.ga</h2>
                <p>Build, destroy, act like an admin or simply go crazy. Minecraft.ga tries to simulate the experience of being an admin or moderator on a server. With access to operator (OP) commands and features used by server staff, you can do heaps of stuff. We have to block a few commands, such as /ban, /kick, /stop etc, to prevent people from abusing too much.</p>
				<p>The world on Minecraft.ga resets automatically once every week, simply to provide you a fresh and lag-free experience. You can save your buildings and continue working on them after the world has reset; more info concerning this will be given once you join the server.</p>
